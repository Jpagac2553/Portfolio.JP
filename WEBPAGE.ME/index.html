	<h2>Hello everyone, I am Jacob Pagac </h2>
  <hr> <p1>I currently reside in the metro Detroit/southeastern Michigan area.</p1 ></hr> <p2>About Me: I have been a skilled trades worker for the past 5 years after graduating highschool. Though the trades have been good to me, I have found much interest in the tech field, because it is very much a "skilled trade" of its own, and the whole process behind development is quite intriguing to me. </p2> <p3>I am happy to learn, commit, and network to start this journey. Outside of work and development, I enjoy: <ul> Playing guitar</ul> <ul> Biking </ul> <ul> Hiking </ul> </hr> </h2> <hr> </p3>
